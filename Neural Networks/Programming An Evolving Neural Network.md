## **Unsupervised Learning**

**Input Layer**
`def here`

**Hidden Layers**
`def here`

**Output Layer**
`def here`

>Each step in Layers are notated by stepping up L1, L2, L3, etc. There are more than one hidden layer that steps down. This is just an example for comprehension. 

Notice how each layer and subsequent hidden layer can have a different number of ==nodes== (neurons). This is because each Layer is held in an ==array==.

>**The example layers above array would look like:**
L1 - `[1,2,3]`
L2 - `[1,2,3,4,5]`
L3 - `[1,2]`

The array of layers is then wrapped into a matr
