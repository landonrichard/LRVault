# LRVault
This Repo is an Obsidian Vault for ITIM tools and resources. This is my personal repository of information for anything ITIM based. This is also used for NCL challenge resources. Images do not work from GitHub page, you need to import into Obsidian.

## Description

This Obsidian Vault is my personal vault that I am publishing here in the off chance that someone else finds the information useful. I have it setup where every time I open and close Obsidian Git pushes out new updates if anything was changed. I am doing this with a plugin called "Obsidian Git".
In my opinion the best way to view this information is using Obsidian and cloning the repository.

### How to Use with Obsidian

>First Download and Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

>Download the LRVault Repository

>Open Obsidian and Choose Import Current Vault

>Choose Directory of the Downloaded Repository
