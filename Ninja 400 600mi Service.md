## **<u>Idle Inspection</u>**
> #### <u>Check Throttle Cables</u>
> - Start the engine and warm it up
>- With engine idling, turn the handlebars to both sides
>- **If handlebars movement changes the idle, the throttle cables may be improperly adjusted or incorrectly routed or damaged. ** 
>- *Be sure to correct any of these conditions before riding (see Throttle Control System Inspection and Cable, Wire, and Hose Routing section in the Appendix chapter).*
>- ![[Idle Speed Inspection.png]]
> #### <u>Check Idle Speed</u>
> - **Standard Idle: 1250-1350rpm**
> - *If the idle speed is out of specified range, check the idle speed control valve actuator (see idle Speed Control Valve Actuator Resistance inspection in the Fuel System (DFI) chapter).*

## **<u>Throttle Control System Inspection</u>**
> #### <u>Check Throttle Grip</u>
> - **Check that the throttle grip moves smoothly from full open to close, and the throttle closes quickly and completely. Do this in all steering positions.**
> - *If the throttle grip does not return properly, check the cable routing and **lubricate the throttle cable**.
>#### <u>Check Throttle Grip Free Play</u>
> - **Standard Free Play: 0.08-0.12in**
> - *If the free play is incorrect, adjust the throttle cable as follows: Check 2-16 in service manual*

## **<u>Fuel System Inspection</u>**
> #### <u>Fuel Hose Inspection</u>
> - Check the fuel hose for fuel leaks
> - Check the fuel hose for any fraying, cracks or bulges. 
> - Check that the fuel hose joints are securlty connected by:
> 	- Push and pull the fuel hose joint back and forth more than two times
> 	- Make sure it is locked and does not come off
> - ![[Fuel Hose Diagram.png]]
> - ![[Fuel Hose Location.png]]

## **<u>Cooling System</u>**
> #### <u>Coolant Level Inspection</u>
> - Check the  level when the engine is cold
> - Check the level in the reserve tank with motorcycle upright.
> - **If coolant is lower than the L level line (A). Add coolant**
> - ![[Coolant Level.png]]
> #### <u>Cooling System Inspection</u>
> - Inspect the hoses for signs of deterioration. Squeeze the hoses.
> - A hose should not be hard or brittle, nor should it be soft or swollen.
> - **Replace the hose if any fraying, cracks, or bulges are notices**
> - Check that the hoses are securely connected
> - ![[Cooling system.png]]

## **<u>Clutch</u>**
> #### <u>Clutch Operation Inspection</u>
> - Pull the lever just enough to take up the free play
> - Measure the gap between the lever and the lever holder
> - **Clutch Lever Free Play: 0.08-0.12in**
> - *If the clutch lever free play is incorrect, see page 2-31 of the service manual*

## **<u>Engine Oil</u>**
> #### <u>Engine Oil and Filter Change</u>
> **You will need 3q of oil and an oil filter**
> - Warm up the engine and set the bike upright
> - Remove Lower Left Fairing
> - Unscrew the oil filler plug
> - ![[Oil Cap.png]]
> - Place oil pan underneath engine
> - Remove engine oil drain bolt and drain the oil
> - ![[Oil Drain Plug.png]]
> - Remove the Oil Filter with an oil filter wrench
> - ![[Oil Filter Placement.png]]
> - Apply engine oil to filter Oil Ring
> - ![[Oil Filter.png]]
> - Install new Oil Filter, torque to 12.9 ft-lb
> - Reinstall engine drain bolt and replace drain bolt gasket. Torque drain bolt to 22ft-lb
> - ![[Oil Drain Plug.png]]
> - Pour in 2.0L / 2.1qt of SAE 10W-40 4 Stroke Engine Oil
> - Check oil level

## **<u>Drive Chain</u>**
> #### <u>Chain Lubrication Inspection</u>
> - Lubrication of the chain is necessary after riding through the rain or on wet roads, or any time the chain seems dry
> - If the chain is dirty, clean is with chain cleaner before lubing it
> - Lay down a piece of cardboard or towel before starting
> - Apply oil to the sides of the rollers so the oil will penetrate to the rollers and bushings. Apply the oil to the O-rings so that the O-rings will be coated in oil. 
> - ![[Chain Rollers.png]]
> - Wipe off any excess oil
> - Wipe off any lube that gets on tire
> #### <u>Chain Slack Inspection</u>
> - Check slack with motorcycle on sidestand
> - Check the wheel alignment by:
	>  - Check that the left alignment indicator A aligns with the same swingarm mark or position B that the right alignment indicator notch aligns with.
	>  - ![[Wheel Alignment.png]]
> - Rotate the rear wheel to find the position where the chain is tightest
> - Measure the vertical movement midway between the sprockets
> - **Chain Slack: 0.8-1.2in**
> - *If chain slack is incorrect, see page 2-36*

## **<u>Brakes</u>**
> #### <u>Brake System Inspection</u>
> - Apply the brake lever or pedal and inspect for brake fluid leaks from hoses, fittings, and pipes
> - ![[Front Braking System.png]]
> - ![[Back Braking System.png]]
> #### <u>Brake Operation Inspection</u>
> - **Test that brakes work properly on dry road**
> #### <u>Front Brake Fluid Level Inspection</u>
> - Check that the brake fluid level in the front brake reservoir is above the lower level line.
> 	- *Hold the reservoir horizontal by turning the handlebars*
> - ![[front brake resevour.png]]
> - Fill reservoir if needed
> - Torque front brake reservoir cap screws to 1ft-lb
> -#### <u>Rear Brake Fluid Level Inspection</u>
> - Check that the brake fluid level in the rear brake fluid reservoir is above the lower level line
> - ![[Rear Brake Fluid Level.png]]
> - Add Disk Brake Fluid if needed
> - Reinstall Brake Res Cap by tightening the cap until resistance is felt and then tighten 1/16 of a turn more
> #### <u>Brake Light Switch Inspection</u>
> - **Check that both front and back brake levers flash the brake lights**
> - *If they need adjusting, see page 2-48 of service manual*

## **<u>Steering</u>**
> #### <u>Steering Play Inspection</u>
> - Raise front wheel off the ground.
> - With the front wheel pointing straight ahead, tap each end of the handlebar.
> - The front wheel should swing fully in both directions from the force of gravity.
> - Feel for steering looseness by pushing and pulling the forks
> - ![[Front Steering.png]]
> - *If the wheel needs adjusting, see page 2-51 in service manual to fix it*

## **<u>Condition of Bolts, Buts and Fasteners</u>**
> #### <u>Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners Inspection</u>
> - Check the tightness of the bolts and nuts listed below and check to see that each cotter pin is in place.
> - **If there are loose fasteners, retighten them to spec. You can find this in the Standard Torque Table in the Service Manual. Loosen the fastener by 1/2 before tightening.**
