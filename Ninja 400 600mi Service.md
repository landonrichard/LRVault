>- ![[Idle Speed Inspection.png]]
> #### <u>Check Idle Speed</u>
> - **Standard Idle: 1250-1350rpm**
> - *If the idle speed is out of specified range, check the idle speed control valve actuator (see idle Speed Control Valve Actuator Resistance inspection in the Fuel System (DFI) chapter).*

## **<u>Throttle Control System Inspection</u>**
> #### <u>Check Throttle Grip</u>
> - **Check that the throttle grip moves smoothly from full open to close, and the throttle closes quickly and completely. Do this in all steering positions.**
> - *If the throttle grip does not return properly, check the cable routing and **lubricate the throttle cable**.
>#### <u>Check Throttle Grip Free Play</u>
> - **Standard Free Play: 0.08-0.12in**
> - *If the free play is incorrect, adjust the throttle cable as follows: Check 2-16 in service manual*

## **<u>Fuel System Inspection</u>**
> #### <u>Fuel Hose Inspection</u>

## **<u>Cooling System</u>**
> #### <u>Coolant Level Inspection</u>
> - Check the  level when the engine is cold
> - Check the level in the reserve tank with motorcycle upright.
> - **If coolant is lower than the L level line (A). Add coolant**
> - ![[Coolant Level.png]]
> #### <u>Cooling System Inspection</u>

> - A hose should not be hard or brittle, nor should it be soft or swollen.
> - **Replace the hose if any fraying, cracks, or bulges are notices**
> - Check that the hoses are securely connected

## **<u>Clutch</u>**
> #### <u>Clutch Operation Inspection</u>
> - Pull the lever just enough to take up the free play
> - Measure the gap between the lever and the lever holder
> - **Clutch Lever Free Play: 0.08-0.12in**
> - *If the clutch lever free play is incorrect, see page 2-31 of the service manual*

## **<u>Engine Oil</u>**
> #### <u>Engine Oil and Filter Change</u>
> **You will need 3q of oil and an oil filter**

> #### <u>Chain Slack Inspection</u>
> Check slack with motorcycle on sidestand
> Check the wheel alignment by:
	>  Check that the left alignment indicator A aligns with the same swingarm mark or position B that the right alignment indicator notch aligns with.
	>  ![[Wheel Alignment.png]]
> Rotate the rear wheel to find the position where the chain is tightest
> Measure the vertical movement midway between the sprockets
> **Chain Slack: 0.8-1.2in**
> *If chain slack is incorrect, see page 2-36*
