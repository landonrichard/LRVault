**Purpose**
To evaluate each competitor’s preparation for employment and to recognize outstanding students for excellence and professionalism in the field of computer programming.

**Languages Assessed**
- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL

**Skill Performance Check**
The competition includes a computer programming problem consisting of background information and program specifications with accompanying reference materials and description of program output requirements. An appropriate (successfully executable) computer program from design notes and instructions will be developed.


**Competition Guidelines**
1. The competitors will receive a packet that includes three or four projects. 
2. Each project’s specifications are written for either Java, C, C++, C# Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Objective-C, SQL. 
3. Projects will be scored on the following six criteria: completeness, correctness of output, validation of input, internal documentation, efficiency of code, and quality of work. 
4. The competition will also include an interview to assess competitors’ ability to answer questions typical of an entry-level position for a computer programmer.

Programs are sets of instructions that tell a computer what to do. These instructions are written in programming languages, which are designed to be easily understood by humans and easily translated into machine code that computers can execute.

Programming languages are made up of a set of syntax rules and grammar that define the structure and meaning of the language. These rules govern how the programmer can write code and what actions the code will cause the computer to take.

When a programmer writes code in a programming language, the code is first compiled or interpreted by a compiler or interpreter respectively. Compilers are software programs that take the code written in a programming language and translate it into machine code that can be executed by a computer. Interpreters, on the other hand, translate the code on-the-fly, executing the program directly from the source code without first translating it into machine code.

Once the code is compiled or interpreted, the resulting program can be executed on the computer. The program interacts with the computer hardware and operating system, performing various tasks based on the instructions provided by the programmer.

Overall, programming languages and programs work together to allow humans to communicate their intentions to computers and make them perform useful tasks.
