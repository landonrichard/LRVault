#SkillsUSA
#### Purpose
To evaluate each competitor’s preparation for employment and to recognize outstanding students for excellence and professionalism in the field of computer programming.

---

#### Languages Assessed
- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL

---

#### Skill Performance Check
The competition includes a computer programming problem consisting of background information and program specifications with accompanying reference materials and description of program output requirements. An appropriate (successfully executable) computer program from design notes and instructions will be developed.

---

#### Competition Guidelines
1. The competitors will receive a packet that includes three or four projects. 
2. Each project’s specifications are written for either Java, C, C++, C# Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Objective-C, SQL. 
3. Projects will be scored on the following six criteria: completeness, correctness of output, validation of input, internal documentation, efficiency of code, and quality of work. 
4. The competition will also include an interview to assess competitors’ ability to answer questions typical of an entry-level position for a computer programmer.
