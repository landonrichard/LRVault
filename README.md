# LRVault
This Repo is an Obsidian Vault for ITIM tools and resources. This is my personal repository of information for anything ITIM based. This is also used for NCL challenge resources.

## Description

This Obsidian Vault is my personal vault that I am publishing here in the off chance that someone else finds the information useful. I have it setup where every time I open and close Obsidian Git pushes out new updates if anything was changed. I am doing this with a plugin called "Obsidian Git".
In my opinion the best way to view this information is using Obsidian and cloning the repository.
