#BugBounty
#### Purpose
Bug bounty programs are offered by companies, organizations and websites to incentivize individuals to discover and report security vulnerabilities in their software or online platforms. By offering rewards to security researchers, companies can tap into a larger pool of talent, receive more comprehensive security assessments, and ultimately improve their overall security posture to protect sensitive data and information from being compromised. These programs are seen as an important component of any comprehensive security strategy and are increasingly common in the tech industry.
