## Recover Files from a Git Version Control Directory
#KaliTools 

To recover files from from a git version control directory you need to unzip the file. You can use the command `unzip git_filename.zip`. When you're done `cd` into the new directory.

There are hidden files in the directory to see these files run the command `l -a`.  You can now see that there is a .git directory.

We can now use git to analyze the repository. 
>First check the git log files for the commits
>`git log`
>This will show a list of all the commits with the commit's SHA1 hash, the author, emails, time, and a description for the commit

>Now we can inspect each commit and gather more information.
>`git show <SHA1 Hash goes here>`
>To see the data use the command `git show`

>Now we search through the git branches for more interesting information
>`git branch`
>This will show all the branches and the current branch we are on.
>Use the command `git checkout <branch name>` to move to the next branch

## File Carving to Identify Magic Bytes and Extract Concatenated Files
#KaliTools 

>**Summary from Cyber Skyline**
>Files are a sequence of bytes. Each byte can store a value between 0-255. In order to make sense of these bytes and do something useful, such as display an image or play an audio clip, these bytes are structured into a standardized format, known as a file format, so that a program can make sense of the information. These standardized formats dictate to a program how to interpret the data. For example, the format for an image may dictate that the first byte of the file is the color for the first pixel of the image and the second byte is the color for the second pixel and so on.The format for an audio file may dictate that the first byte is the frequency of the first second of the audio clip and the second byte is the frequency for the second second of the audio clip and so on. If you attempt to view an image with a music player or edit a song using a photo editor, youâ€™ll find that these programs will get confused when trying to process the file and give you an error. There are two primary ways that programs attempt to determine which format is being used by a file: the file extension (eg: .png, .mp3, .pdf) and the file signature, aka magic bytes. The file extension can be found directly in the name of the file while the magic bytes are a unique sequence of bytes values that are directly within the contents of the file itself, usually at the beginning of the file. Often, the file extension is used to determine the file format since checking the filename is more efficient than opening every file in a folder to look for the magic bytes. If a file extension has been modified or changed, this can trick some programs into thinking that they cannot open the file. A simple rename of the program to correct the file extension can quickly solve this problem.

If you download a file that doesn't have an extension you can use the command `file` to analyze the magic bytes and see what kind of file it is.
>An example of the file command
>`file <filename>`
Now that you know what type of file you are working with, you can rename it add the correct extension to the end so that your operation system knows what to do with the file.

If you suspect that the file may be containing multiple files within it. You can use a tool called **binwalk** to identify additional files.

>First we can run binwalk against the file to see what is inside
>`binwalk <filename>`
>This will show a list of the found files

>Next we can extract the found files so that we can analyze them
>`binwalk --extract <filename>`
>This will create a new directory with the name "filename".extracted
